## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Parrot green (#B3FF66) to establish the central theme.
- Background color: Very light greenish grey (#F0F2EB), almost white.
- Accent color: Yellowish green (#C6FF1A) for highlighting active elements and call-to-action buttons.
- Body and headline font: 'PT Sans', sans-serif, combines a modern look and a little warmth.
- Use clean, simple icons to represent different categories, ensuring they are easily recognizable and consistent throughout the app.

- Use subtle transitions and animations, for example when photos are loaded, to enhance user engagement.
